Problem Statement - Food wastage has been an issue of grave concern for the past years. According to Food and
Agriculture Organization data, 1/3rd of food produced for human consumption is wasted
globally, accounting for almost 1.3 billion tons per year. On the other hand, as per WHO, 20% of
the population faces extreme food shortages. It simply means that we donâ€™t lack the food, but
we lack the source to bridge the gap between the extra food and that of hungry folk.

Hence there is a need to come up with a solution that can avoid food wastage & can help feed
the needy by building an interface that will help in easy communication between the NGOs (i.e.
distributors) and the providers.
