            <strong>How long has it been since you have eaten your last meal?</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            2-3 hours?
            <br />
            1 hour?
            <br />
            30 min?
            <br /> Or maybe less than that
            <br />
            <br />
            Some people haven’t had a wholesome meal for quite a long while. There could be nothing
            as unfortunate as seeing a person in this situation.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Want to help ? </strong>
            <i>Care Club </i>comes to your rescue.
            <br />
            The excess food at your place can help us feed someone’s empty stomach. Our app provides
            a user-friendly platform wherein donors from hotels, restaurants or people with extra
            food can link up with the NGOs that are best suited to them so they can further help the
            needy.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Our Vision -</strong>
            <br />
            Currently, the app deals with the provision of food only. Still, with your support and
            help, we could also cover areas like the provision of clothes, recycled products, books
            and anything that other people could reuse.
            <br />
            Food shortage is not the issue. What the real problem is, its availability to the needy
            people.
            <br />
            <br />
            Become a part of the Care Club community and contribute to the society, whether big or
            small. After all,
            <strong> We can’t help everyone, but everyone can help someone.</strong>
